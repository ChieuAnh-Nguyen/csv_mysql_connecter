Imported mysql connector module and connected to local mysql server.
Using jupyterNB because Pycharm and VScode even Sublime Text doesn't recognize mysql connecter.. not even pandas..
Created database then tables with varchar, int, primary keys with auto_increment.
Tested cursor.execute and cursor.executemany

🐢 10/07

Code to enter values into two table with relationship making sure that pk and fk match everytime.
Got Pycharm, VScode, Sublime Text to recognize my modules.
🐢 10/08

Started using VScode instead of JupyterNB because it is easier to see my files and  has more functionality. I see why people use it now.
Pushed code to repository using git.
Created .gitignore file and added a directory and file to it.
